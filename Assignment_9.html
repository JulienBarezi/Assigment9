<h1>Assignment 9</h1>

As Usual , congratulations on the work that you have done in the previous work, I am proud of you :)<br>
In this assignment we are testing how well can we work with files<br><br>

Let's play<br><br>

As the user comes in , create a file with their name ,
and on that file record everything that they have done in your system.<br>
And this is a plus ,if you can take the user input from a file,<br>
like Mr. Omondi can give you a file with all the cars he want to<br>
put in his system and you just create everything by reading from the file.<br><br>

Remember to put the description of your project in the readme file
and anything that the user need to install in order to use your project (10%)<br>
This assignment will be graded on a hundred ,good news, if you get assignment 8 wrong,
you have a chance to redeem yourself , make it right and you get 20% more on it.<br><br>

Go my Giants , go get me hundreds :)<br>
Have Fun :)<br>
